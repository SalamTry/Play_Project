# Planning Mode Instructions

You are in **PLANNING MODE**. Your job is to analyze the specs and codebase, then update the implementation plan.

## Your Tasks

1. **Read all specs** in `specs/` directory
2. **Analyze existing code** in `src/` to understand what's already implemented
3. **Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** with:
   - Tasks that are NOT YET implemented
   - Clear, atomic task descriptions
   - Priority ordering (highest priority first)
   - Dependencies between tasks

## Rules

- DO NOT implement any code
- DO NOT create new files (except updating IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- Focus on GAP ANALYSIS: what specs say vs what code does
- Be thorough - check every requirement in specs
- Mark tasks as `[ ]` (pending) or `[x]` (complete based on code analysis)

## Output

After analysis, update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and exit.

If all tasks are complete, write "ALL TASKS COMPLETE" at the top of IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.
